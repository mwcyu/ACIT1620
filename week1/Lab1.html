        Mega Minions shows up in Despicable Me 4. They have been enhanced with a 
        super serum by the Anti-Villain League.
        This is a parady of the super soldier serum used in the Marvel scenematic universe. 
        Each Mega Minion possesses unique abilities: Mega Minion Dave has incredible strength, 
        Mega Minion Gus can levitate and fly, Mega Minion Tim can stretch his body to great lengths, 
        Mega Minion Mel can fire an incendiary beam from his lens, 
        and Mega Minion Jerry becomes an incredibly dense rocky sphere.

        In the movie, they were not very helpful when they first got their new powers.
        They even briefly went into retirement. However, during the climax of the movie,
        they were able to paralyze the main villain, Maxime Le Mal. They were able to finally be
        real heros and saved the day.
